## cloudy ‚òÅÔ∏è (work in progress)
Cloudy is an open-source weather app for Android that provides users with up-to-date weather information based on their current location, as well as a week-long forecast. It is built using the latest Android technologies and follows the MVVM with clean architecture, with an offline-first approach that caches weather data for improved performance.

- [Jetpack Components](https://developer.android.com/jetpack) - Compose, ViewModel and more
- [Dagger Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/)
- [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html) & [Flow](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow)
- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/)

- [JUnit](https://junit.org/junit5/) & [Mockito](https://site.mockito.org/)
- [Fastlane](https://fastlane.tools/)

### Development Setup
To build and run the app, you will need the latest version of Android Studio Giraffe (or newer) installed on your system.

### Weather API
The weather data is provided by the [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api), which requires an API key. To store your Open Weather API key, add it to your `local.properties` file as follows:

````properties
OPEN_WEATHER_API_KEY=[YOUR_API_KEY]
````

The app retrieves the user's location using the device's GPS and uses the latitude and longitude to fetch the current weather and forecast for the next five days from the Open Weather API.
